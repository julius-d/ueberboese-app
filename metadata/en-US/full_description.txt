Überböse App is the companion app for the Überböse API server (https://github.com/julius-d/ueberboese-api).

The app has two main purposes:

1. Set up Spotify authentication for your self-hosted Überböse API server.
Note: For this to work, you need a Spotify account and the self-hosted Überböse API.

2. Control your Bose SoundTouch speakers directly via the SoundTouch WebServices API that is provided by each speaker.
Note: For this to work, no Spotify account is needed.
Features:
- Multi-Room Audio: Control and view speaker zones for synchronized playback
- Volume Control: Adjust volume levels for individual speakers
- Now Playing: See what's currently playing on your speakers
- Preset Management: Configure and manage Spotify presets on your speakers
